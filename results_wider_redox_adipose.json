        "abstract": "Overweight and obesity have been increasing drastically in recent years due to the growing consumption of fast food. Obese individuals exhibit reduced antioxidant defenses, which can lead to DNA damage. Thus, studies have been conducted to mitigate obesity-related complications. Animal research has used the cafeteria diet (CAF) as an obesity induction model, as it mimics human consumption of ultra-processed foods. Currently, complementary dietary strategies are being explored to prevent and/or alleviate obesity-related complications, particularly through natural compounds with anti-obesity effects. Among these, melatonin (MEL) has gained attention due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of melatonin supplementation on biochemical, genotoxic, and inflammatory parameters in mice fed a CAF diet. A total of 60 male Swiss mice were divided into six experimental groups (n=10): (1) Standard Diet (SD) - fed standard chow for 21 weeks; (2) SD + MEL - fed standard chow and supplemented with melatonin for 24 weeks; (3) CAF - fed CAF for 21 weeks; (4) CAF + MEL - fed CAF and supplemented with melatonin; (5) CAF / CAF + MEL - fed CAF for the first 17 weeks, then continued CAF while starting melatonin supplementation for the last four weeks, totaling 17 weeks of CAF; (6) CAF + MEL / CAF - fed CAF and supplemented with melatonin for the first 17 weeks, then stopped melatonin supplementation for the last four weeks, totaling 21 weeks. Blood samples were collected at 17 and 21 weeks to assess DNA damage, lipid profile (triglycerides, total cholesterol, and HDL), liver function (ALT and AST), inflammatory markers (TNF-α and IL-10), fasting glucose, and insulin tolerance in all six groups. At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized, and liver, kidney, adipose tissue, and bone marrow were collected for further analyses, including the Comet Assay, Micronucleus Test, oxidative stress evaluation, and Western blot. Results showed that CAF induced an inflammatory state, characterized by increased TNF-α and decreased IL-10, along with alterations in lipid and liver profiles. Additionally, CAF led to DNA damage in multiple tissues and insulin resistance. MEL supplementation for 17 weeks reversed these changes. In the last four weeks of the experiment, CAF was associated with oxidative stress and damage in the liver, kidney, and bone marrow. MEL effectively attenuated these obesity-related alterations, primarily by modulating proteins involved in homologous and non-homologous DNA repair pathways. In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that MEL is a potent antioxidant and may be a promising candidate for reducing biochemical and genetic alterations associated with obesity.",

        "title": "Effects of jabuticaba, a Brazilian berry, on obesity, metabolic parameters, and gut health in high-fat diet animal models: a systematic review.",
        "journal": "Food & function",
        "abstract": "Obesity induces metabolic disturbances, chronic inflammation, and gut dysbiosis, increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome and related diseases. Functional foods rich in bioactive compounds are promising strategies to modulate some of these metabolic pathways. Brazil hosts one of the most biodiverse floras in the world, with native fruits rich in bioactive compounds that remain underexplored. Among these, jabuticaba (<i>Plinia</i> spp.), a Brazilian berry, is rich in phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins, which confer antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic benefits. This systematic review aimed to evaluate whether jabuticaba consumption can attenuate the changes caused by a high-fat diet on obesity-related outcomes <i>in vivo</i>. Following PRISMA guidelines, 323 articles were identified from four databases, and 21 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. Interventions included jabuticaba powder or extracts from the whole fruit or peel. Findings showed that jabuticaba intake reduced inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in adipose tissue, liver, colon, and skeletal muscle, improved insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance. Additionally, it reduced weight gain and adiposity, promoted improvements in the blood lipid profile, reduced hepatic steatosis, modulated fecal pH and lipid content, strengthened the intestinal barrier, and remodeled the gut microbiota. Although studies show promising metabolic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects of jabuticaba in obesity models, variability in study designs, dosages, and intervention protocols limits comparability. Evidence on bioavailability and mechanisms remains scarce. Further research is needed to confirm the safety, efficacy, and bioavailability of jabuticaba in humans. This review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024599910).",
