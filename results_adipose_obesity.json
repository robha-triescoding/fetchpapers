        "journal": "International journal of food sciences and nutrition",
        "abstract": "Obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular complications, represent a major global health burden. A key pathogenic mechanism linking these conditions is the overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which triggers caspase-1 activation and promotes proinflammatory cytokine release (e.g., IL-1β and IL-18), driving adipose tissue dysfunction, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. Emerging evidence highlights dietary polyphenols as natural modulators of NLRP3 activity attenuating inflammasome activation by regulating NF-κB signalling, reducing oxidative stress and restoring autophagy. Complementary <i>in silico</i> approaches (e.g., molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, network pharmacology) provide mechanistic insights into polyphenol-inflammasome interactions. This review summarises current evidence on the NLRP3's role in obesity-related disorders and discusses the therapeutic potential of dietary polyphenols, underscoring directions for translational and multidisciplinary research.",

        "journal": "Immunity, inflammation and disease",
        "abstract": "Obesity-related comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, are associated with chronic inflammation mediated by macrophages. This inflammation is characterized by the accumulation of macrophages in crown-like structures (CLS) surrounding dead adipocytes within adipose tissue. In a recent study, we reported a significant reduction in CLS-associated macrophages following bariatric surgery. The NLRP3 inflammasome and its downstream effector, Caspase-1, are well-established mediators of metabolic dysfunction and inflammation in obesity. Immunohistochemical single- and multiplex staining of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) samples from patients with obesity was performed to characterize the detailed distribution of NLRP3 and Caspase-1. The samples were collected during gastric bypass surgery and at a 1-year follow-up. Both NLRP3 and Caspase-1 were expressed by CD68-positive macrophages in SAT including both single macrophages and those forming CLS. A reduction in the total number of SAT macrophages expressing these proteins was detected following gastric bypass. Furthermore, NLRP3 and Caspse-1 were observed in the endothelium of vascular structures. Our findings demonstrate that both CLS-forming and single cell macrophage populations in human adipose tissue express NLRP3 and Caspase-1. The study highlights the significance of the NLRP3 inflammasome macrophages in the pathogenesis of adipose tissue inflammation in obesity. The previously reported abundance of CLS in untreated obesity and their reduction after bariatric surgery suggest that the NLRP3-Caspase-1 axis within CLS may serve as an important mediator of the beneficial metabolic effects associated with bariatric surgery.",

        "journal": "Cardiovascular research",
        "abstract": "Although growing evidence suggests that obesity/central adiposity predispose to development and exacerbation of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), it remains to be clarified whether there is a causal relationship between adiposity and HFpEF pathogenesis. HFpEF was induced in male, C57BL/6N mice using high-fat diet + Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. Resection or transplantation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) blunted or exacerbated HFpEF phenotypes, respectively, the in mice. VAT from HFpEF mice displayed greater weight and secreted more small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) than those from chow-fed mice. Either systemic inhibition of sEV secretion or VAT-specific knockdown of Rab27b (an indispensable GTPase for sEV secretion) protected against HFpEF. Discovery-driven experiments identified miR-295-3p within sEVs as a possible mediator of the VAT-heart axis, which impaired cardiac autophagy by binding to Ulk1 mRNA. MiR-295-3p antagomir treatment mitigated HFpEF phenotypes. Additionally, neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (NMCMs) manifested blunted autophagic flux after treatment with plasma sEVs from HFpEF mice. Notably, HFpEF patients displayed downregulated cardiac Ulk1 and autophagy compared with healthy individuals. Restoration of cardiac autophagy with rapamycin or ULK1 overexpression via AAV-9 attenuated the HFpEF phenotype in mice. The present work unveils a mechanism whereby obesity promotes HFpEF progression, emphasizing the role of VAT-heart crosstalk. Specifically, VAT-derived sEVs, miR-295-3p, and the resultant disruption of cardiac autophagy contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of HFpEF.",

        "journal": "Molecular human reproduction",
        "abstract": "PCOS is the most common reproductive endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age. It is characterized by excess androgens, anovulation, and polycystic ovarian morphology, and is often accompanied by obesity, insulin resistance and glucose metabolism abnormalities. Although PCOS is a complex disease with diverse and uncertain etiologies, metabolic dysfunction and adipose tissue abnormalities are critical components in its pathology. Previous studies have demonstrated that letrozole exposure combined with high-fat diet treatment in female mice produced key endocrine and metabolic features of PCOS, including elevated testosterone levels, anovulation, and adipocyte hypertrophy. Orosomucoid 2 (ORM2), an acute-phase protein predominantly secreted by hepatocytes, plays a regulatory role in metabolic balance and gut microbiota composition. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ORM2 levels on the metabolic and endocrine dysregulations associated with letrozole-induced PCOS in female mice. We established a letrozole-induced PCOS by treating mice with Let+HFD (letrozole and high-fat diet) for 5 weeks. Our findings revealed that compared to control females receiving placebo and high-fat diet treatment, females treated with Let+HFD exhibited significantly reduced hepatic Orm2 expression. Furthermore, Orm2 knockout mice subjected to Let+HFD treatment developed more severe ovarian pathology, higher testosterone levels, hepatocyte hypertrophy, and reduced Ucp1 expression in white adipose tissue compared to wild-type mice. Conversely, supplementation with recombinant ORM2 protein in females under Let+HFD treatment resulted in improved ovarian morphology, reduced hepatocyte cell size, and enhanced Ucp1 expression in white adipose tissue. Overall, this research identifies ORM2 as a promising therapeutic target for PCOS treatment.",

        "journal": "Experimental hematology & oncology",
        "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) in breast cancer is shaped by reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and their surrounding stromal populations. Here, we show that breast adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells (bASCs) undergo distinct state transitions in response to tumor cues and systemic metabolic status. Using primary bASCs derived from tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant adipose tissues of breast cancer patients with or without obesity, we identify two functionally distinct, tumor-educated stromal phenotypes: a cytokine-rich inflammatory CAF-like (iCAF) state predominating in lean-adjacent bASCs (ln-aT), and a myofibroblastic CAF-like (myCAF) state emerging in obese-adjacent bASCs (ob-aT). Importantly, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is sufficient to induce myCAF-like reprogramming in obesity-primed bASCs, while interleukin 1 (IL1)-Janus kinase (JAK) signaling promotes iCAF features. Re-analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data of breast cancer samples reveals an increased TGFβ expression across stromal and immune cell types in individuals with obesity. Mechanistically, IL1 receptor blockade (anakinra) or JAK inhibition (AZD1480) reverses both iCAF and myCAF phenotypes and functionally suppresses stromal-driven epithelial-mesenchymal transition as well as cancer stemness in breast cancer cells. These findings establish a mechanistic link between obese cues, stromal plasticity, and breast cancer progression, and reveal IL1/JAK signaling as a tractable axis to therapeutically reprogram the breast cancer stroma.",
