        "title": "Obesity, Bariatric Surgery, and Cancer Risk: Nutritional Perspectives and Long-Term Clinical Implications.",
        "journal": "Nutrients",
        "abstract": "Obesity is recognized as a causal risk factor for the development of multiple cancers, with risk magnitude varying by tumor site, sex, life stage, and adipose tissue distribution. This narrative review synthesizes recent epidemiological evidence linking excess body fatness with cancer incidence and mortality and integrates the biological mechanisms that explain this association. Chronic low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinemia, dysregulation of adipose-derived hormones and sex steroids, impairment of anti-tumor immune responses, alterations in the gut microbiota, and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment collectively create conditions that favor tumor initiation and progression. Bariatric surgery is the most effective clinical intervention for achieving substantial and sustained weight loss in individuals with severe obesity, and growing evidence indicates that it is associated with a reduction in overall cancer risk and cancer-related mortality, particularly for malignancies strongly linked to obesity. However, the extent of this benefit differs by surgical technique and remains less consistent for colorectal cancer. Beyond metabolic improvements, bariatric surgery produces long-term changes in nutritional physiology that may also influence oncologic outcomes. Persistent deficiencies of micronutrients such as iron, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin D, and calcium can affect DNA synthesis, methylation, oxidative balance, and cellular repair. Altered protein and energy intake may contribute to loss of lean mass and reduced metabolic resilience, while changes in alcohol absorption and metabolism can increase systemic exposure to ethanol and its carcinogenic metabolites. In addition, bariatric surgery induces sustained remodeling of the gut microbiome and bile acid metabolism, which may further modulate tumorigenic signaling. Overall, the oncological impact of bariatric surgery reflects a balance between metabolic improvement and long-term nutritional management, underscoring the need for structured follow-up and targeted nutritional strategies to optimize cancer risk reduction.",

        "title": "The Antioxidant Quercetin Affects Mitochondrial Function and Inhibits the Differentiation of Human Preadipocytes.",
        "journal": "Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",
        "abstract": "Obesity is associated with numerous pathological processes in the body, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and consequently, mitochondrial dysfunction. In recent years, research in anti-obesity therapy has also focused on the function of adipocytes and the inhibition of adipogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effect of the well-known flavonoid quercetin on mitochondrial function, apoptosis and differentiation of human preadipocytes. The Chub-S7 cell line model was used in the in vitro studies. Mitochondrial function was measured by oxygen consumption rates, intracellular ATP content, mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis assay (Annexin-5, caspase-9 activity), and ROS generation. Chub-S7 cell differentiation was assessed by Oil Red O staining. The results showed that the quercetin inhibited differentiation of human Chub-S7 preadipocytes and reduced fat accumulation in lipid droplets. Additionally, quercetin influenced mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial uncoupling by changes in mitochondrial respiratory states and also increased mitochondrial membrane potential. Quercetin decreased routine respiration, R/E and netROUTINE control ratio. Our results demonstrate that quercetin is a dietary component that may modulate mitochondrial bioenergetics and inhibit adipogenesis. If these results were confirmed in in vivo studies, quercetin could be considered a factor used to prevent obesity.",

        "title": "Functional Foods as Modulators of Epigenetic Mechanisms Affecting Metabolic Health in Adolescence.",
        "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences",
        "abstract": "Adolescence represents a critical window of metabolic plasticity, during which profound hormonal, neurobiological, and physiological remodelling increases susceptibility to nutritional exposures. In parallel with the rising prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease among young people, there is growing interest in the potential for functional food components to modulate epigenetic pathways that govern metabolic programming. This narrative review synthesises current evidence (2015-2025) from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase to elucidate how diet-derived bioactive compounds influence epigenetic regulation relevant to adipogenesis, appetite control, insulin signalling, and lipid homeostasis during adolescence. Particular emphasis is placed on molecular mechanisms, including DNA methylation changes in genes regulating adipocyte differentiation, hypothalamic neuropeptide expression, and pancreatic β-cell function; histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation events that remodel chromatin accessibility in metabolic tissues; and modulation of microRNA networks implicated in lipid metabolism, inflammatory signalling, and insulin secretion. Furthermore, the review examines the interplay between diet, the gut microbiota, and the epigenome, highlighting the role of microbially derived short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as endogenous histone deacetylase inhibitors and mediators of epigenetic remodelling in adipose tissue. By linking these mechanisms to specific functional food components, including polyphenols, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, fermentable dietary fibre, and other bioactive molecules, we demonstrate how nutritional signals can counteract maladaptive metabolic trajectories and potentially reduce the intergenerational transmission of metabolic risk. A deeper understanding of these epigenetic effects provides the foundation for developing personalised nutrition strategies aimed at preventing metabolic disorders from emerging during adolescence and beyond.",

        "journal": "International journal of molecular sciences",
        "abstract": "<i>Terminalia bellirica</i> extract (TBE) has long been utilized in Ayurvedic medicine across Indian and surrounding regions for diverse therapeutic applications. Despite its traditional prominence, systematic investigations addressing the anti-obesity efficacy and underlying mechanisms remain limited. In this study, we evaluated the anti-obesity potential of TBE using both 3T3-L1 adipocyte and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mice model. In vitro studies using 3T3-L1 adipocytes demonstrated that TBE significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and downregulated key genes involved in adipogenesis and lipogenesis, while upregulating genes promoted lipolysis and energy metabolism. To validate these cellular effects in a physiological context, mice were randomly assigned to six groups: normal control (NC), HFD-induced obese (C), HFD with metformin (100 mg/kg b.w., PC), and HFD with TBE at 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg b.w. Consistent with the in vitro findings, TBE supplementation significantly reduced body weight gain, adipose tissue mass, and adipocyte size in HFD-induced obese mice. Taken together, these results indicate that TBE exerts anti-obesity effects through modulation of adipose tissue metabolic pathways, highlighting its therapeutic potential for obesity management.",
