        "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for chronic diseases and early death; however, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Whereas insulin resistance and inflammation are established pathways in several of these relationships, it is less clear how increases in body adipose tissue relate to these pathways and disease risk. Several adipose tissue-derived blood-based biomarkers have been identified as purported mediators, including adipokines, inflammatory cytokines and sex steroid hormones. Traditionally, these markers were discovered in animal models and their relevance in humans has then been investigated in epidemiological studies. Today, proteomics and metabolomics approaches in human observational studies are used to discover obesity biomarkers in blood, supported by Mendelian randomization studies to draw causal inferences. Here we review adipose tissue-derived blood-based obesity biomarkers and their relevance for disease risk, along with their potential role as mediators. Proteomics and metabolomics studies have partly re-identified traditional biomarkers, but more large-scale prospective analyses are needed to obtain evidence of the relevance of omics-based and traditional obesity biomarkers to disease.",

        "journal": "Endocrinology",
        "abstract": "Dysregulation of hepatokines has been observed in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), suggesting their involvement in disease progression. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP), a hepatokine, in the progression of MASLD, and to evaluate its potential therapeutic utility. Reanalysis of hepatic RNA-seq datasets from patients with fatty liver disease showed that expression of the hepatic AGP gene decreased with disease progression. A high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model of MASLD also showed decreased plasma and hepatic AGP levels. Whole-body AGP-knockout (AGP-KO) mice were fed a HFD for 12 weeks. Compared to wild-type mice, AGP-KO mice fed a HFD displayed further exacerbated hepatic steatosis, obesity, adipose tissue inflammation and impaired glucose tolerance, suggesting a protective role for endogenous AGP against MASLD. Morphological abnormalities of hepatic mitochondria were observed in AGP-KO mice. Human-derived AGP (hAGP) was isolated and purified from plasma fraction V supernatant derived from human blood donations using ion-exchange column chromatography. hAGP exerted a protective effect against palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, adipocytes and macrophages. Exogenous administration of hAGP to MASLD mice attenuated disease progression by reducing hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and adipose tissue inflammation. In conclusion, decreased endogenous AGP levels may contribute to the disease progression of MASLD. AGP has the potential to serve as a novel therapeutic agent against MASLD by targeting both liver and adipose tissue.",

        "journal": "International journal of environmental health research",
        "abstract": "Coffee parchment, an abundant by-product of coffee processing, is rich in bioactive compounds and represents a nutraceutical resource. This study investigates the differential effects of aqueous and hydro-methanolic coffee parchment extracts on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) metabolism and oxidative status in an obesity rat model. Dried coffee parchment was used to prepare aqueous extracts using distilled water and ultrasonic treatment, and hydro-methanolic extracts using water/methanol mixture. Male Wistar rats were fed a cafeteria diet to induce obesity, and then treated with aqueous or hydro-methanolic extracts (100\u2009mg/kg/day). SAT and VAT depots were analyzed for lipids, lipogenic/lipolytic enzymes, and redox markers. Coffee parchment supplementation reduced VAT mass, increased SAT mass, improved insulin sensitivity, and restored antioxidant capacity in obese rats. In VAT, both extracts decreased lipids, with enzyme modulation. In SAT, extracts promoted lipid storage via increased lipogenic enzymes with reduced lipolysis. The aqueous extract exerted stronger effects on VAT lipid reduction and subcutaneous fat preservation. In conclusion, parchment polyphenols modulate adipose tissue distribution, shifting lipid storage from metabolically harmful VAT to SAT, while improving systemic metabolic and oxidative status. These findings highlight the potential of coffee parchment as a sustainable functional ingredient for obesity management.",

        "journal": "Journal of physiology and biochemistry",
        "abstract": "Overweight impacts over 390\u00a0million children and adolescents worldwide, of whom around 160\u00a0million are living with obesity. Adipose tissue biology in pediatric obesity is still relatively unknown. Adaptations to obesity including fat mobilization and remodeling are being investigated. The objective was to examine the lipidomic profile of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue (sWAT and vWAT, respectively) in children with obesity compared to those with normal weight, in order to identify novel lipid species modulated by obesity. Thirty pediatric patients with and without obesity were prospectively recruited at a referral single center and clinical data were reported. sWAT and vWAT samples were obtained for lipidomic analysis. Novel lipid species, including ether-linked triglycerides, ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine, and oxidized triglycerides, were identified as altered in the sWAT from children with obesity compared with normal-weight children. These species are involved in beige adipose tissue development, energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress. Compared with normal-weight children, the vWAT lipidome from children with obesity showed significant changes in some glycerophosphocholines, ceramides, and diglycerides, with accumulation of lipid species involved in inflammation, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk. The observed lipid correlations between vWAT and sWAT highlighted systemic dysregulation of lipid storage in childhood obesity, identifying both shared and depot-specific mechanisms of lipid handling. Our study reveals several critical lipid species that are modulated across both WAT depots, with notable implications for oxidative stress, lipid storage, and adipose tissue dysfunction. Key Points \u2022 The adipose lipidome of children with obesity showed specific alterations. \u2022 Lipid correlations revealed shared and depot-specific lipid handling mechanisms. \u2022 The altered lipid species had an impact on oxidative stress and insulin resistance.",

        "title": "Brown Adipocyte-Derived SAA3-CPT1A Axis Regulates Diet-Induced Thermogenesis and Protects Against Obesity.",
        "journal": "The Journal of nutritional biochemistry",
        "abstract": "Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), a critical component of energy expenditure driven by brown adipose tissue (BAT), is essential for maintaining metabolic health; however, its precise molecular regulation remains poorly understood. We investigated whether Serum Amyloid A3 (SAA3), a factor secreted by brown adipocytes, regulates DIT and protects against diet-induced obesity. Using two distinct mouse models: mice with brown adipocyte-specific Saa3 deletion and mice with lentiviral-mediated Saa3 overexpression in BAT, we examined energy expenditure (EE), substrate utilization, and thermogenic responses under chow or short-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. SAA3 expression in BAT was acutely induced by refeeding. Loss of SAA3 severely diminished postprandial DIT and total EE, leading to accelerated weight gain on an HFD. Mechanistically, Saa3 deletion compromised UCP1 induction, chiefly by impairing ATGL-driven lipolysis and, critically, by inhibiting Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A)-dependent fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Conversely, SAA3 overexpression robustly enhanced DIT, stimulated lipolysis and FAO, and promoted mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Studies in primary brown adipocytes confirmed that SAA3 deficiency reduced CPT1A expression, palmitate-stimulated lipolysis, and mitochondrial respiration. Together, these findings identify the SAA3-CPT1A axis as a novel, BAT-intrinsic mechanism that couples nutrient sensing to UCP1 function via enhanced FAO. By promoting lipid utilization and postprandial energy dissipation, SAA3 optimizes postprandial thermogenesis and defends against obesity, highlighting conserved SAA signaling as a potential nutritional and therapeutic target in metabolic disease.",
